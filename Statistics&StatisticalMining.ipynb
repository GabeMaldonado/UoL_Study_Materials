        "## Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Descriptive Statistics** is the branch of statistics that deals with the collection, summary, presentation and analysis of data in order to transform data into information which can be easily understood and interpreted\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Inferential Statistics** is the branch of statistics that involves using data from a sample to make claims, predictions, estimates and test hypotheses about the characteristics of a population. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Population and Sample\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Population** is the set of all possible individuals, or elements, of interest in a particular study.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Sample** is a subset, or portion, of the population that is representative of the population from which it was selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "* A specific characteristic of a population is called a parameter\n",
        "* A parameter is a fixed population\n",
        "* A specific characteristic of a sample is called a statistic\n",
        "* A sample statistic varies from sample to sample\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Population: all the sutdents at a university\n",
        "* Variable of interest: age\n",

        "## Scales of Measurement\n",
        "\n",
        "* A variable has one of four scales or levels of data measurement:\n",
        "   * nominal\n",
        "   * ordinal\n",
        "   * interval\n",
        "   * ration\n",
        "\n",
        "* The level of measurement determines the amount of information the data contains and is an indicator of the most suitable data summary and statistical analysis. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Nominal Scale\n",
        "* In the nominal scale of measurement, arbitrary labels or names are used to identify a characteristics of the individual. For instance, we have data of how people commute: walk, drive, train, bust, etc. The scale here is nominal beacause labels are used to identify how people go to work. Even if the labels are numeric, there is no order or ranking to it. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Ordinal Scale\n",
        "* In this scale of measurement, the data shows all the properties of nominal data and there is an **order or rank** among the variable's observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* When numeric codes are used, there is no measurable meaning to the number differences. For instance, variables could be eduation level, from elementary to doctorate level of education. Here the levels can be ranked.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Interval Scale\n",
        "\n",
        "* Interval scales are numeric scales in which data exhibits the properties of ordinal scale and the differences between the values is meaningful and specified on a fixed unit of measure. For instance, SATs test scores are interval data which can be ranked. \n",
        "\n",
        "* Interval scale has no true zero point, which means that zero does not mean the of value but simply indicates another value on the scale. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Ratio Scale\n",
        "\n",
        "* Ratio scale exhibits all the properties of interval data and the ration of any two values is meaningful. This scale also has a true zero point, that is, when the variable equals 0.0-, there is none of that variable. \n",
        "* Other examples of variables which used teh ration scale of measurement are weight, height and time. \n",
